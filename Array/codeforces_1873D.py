# The first line contains a single integer t(1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
# The first line of each test case contains two integers n
# and k(1≤k≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the paper and the integer used in the operation.
# The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n
# consisting of characters B(representing a black cell) or W(representing a white cell).
# The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105 .
# For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to remove all black cells.
