# The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers : the j - th integer in the i - th line of the input
# represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i - th row and the j - th column.It is
# guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.
# Print a single integer â€” the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.
